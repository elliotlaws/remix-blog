          I'm a software engineer. I was born in 1992 and grew up in Hartlepool,
          North East England. I went to Leeds Metropolitan University (now Leeds
          Becket) and graduated with a degree in Music Technology.

          How I became a software engineer
        </h3>
        <p>
          My first 'proper' job after University was working as a Data Verifier
          at StepChange Debt Charity (yes, it's as mundane as it sounds). I
          quickly grew very fed up and bored in this role and started messing
          around with VB scripts and Excel to create a 'note generator/template'
          app for the department to use. This eventually got me recognised by
          the IT department and I got my first job in IT as a Service Desk
          Engineer. Although this gave me my first step into the world of IT, it
          was never really for me (I posessed little patience for resetting
          passwords). I always knew that I wanted to pursue the whole web/app
          developer thing
