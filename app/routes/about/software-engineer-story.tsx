        How I became a software engineer
      </h2>
      <p>
        My first 'proper' job after University was working as a Data Verifier at
        StepChange Debt Charity (yes, it's as mundane as it sounds). I quickly
        grew quite fed up in this role and started messing around with VB
        scripts and Excel to create a 'note generator/template' app for my
        department to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, this got me recognised by the IT department and I got my
        first job in IT as a Service Desk Engineer. Although this gave me my
        first step into the world of IT, it was never really for me (I posessed
        little patience for resetting passwords). I always knew that I wanted to
        pursue the whole web/app developer thing, so I applied for internal web
        develeoper roles and third time around I got a job as a Junior Web
        Developer (kinda).
      </p>
      <p>
        I put <i>kinda</i> in parenthesis because in reality, the job was more
        application support than web development. My day to day mainly consisted
        of working with SQL to run a fix into the databse...pretty monontanous
        stuff. Although, I did manage to decrease the teams <i>incidents</i> by
        automating things and working with the team to get permenant fixes in
        and while in the role I began teaching myself languas such as C#,
        JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was learning a lot during this time and it got to the point where I
        felt confident enough to take things to the next level and so, I put
        myself out there to find a 'proper' dev job. I landed on Answer Digital,
        they were a digital consultancy and the role included a three month
        training academy to learn the fundamentals of full-stack development.
        The tech stack was .NET on the back-end with various different JS
        frameworks on the front-end. This was a big leap into the deep end,
        maybe too deep...after only a few months in I'd been on about 4
        different projects, all with different technologies. It was difficult to
        settle into the role and get used to the technologies when there were so
        many changes. Of all the technologies/languages/frameworks I touched,
        React and TypeScript became my favourite and I made the move into the
        world of React, Node and TypeScript in my next role as a Front-End
        Developer at Sycous.
