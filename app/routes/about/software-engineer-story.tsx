            My first full-time job after University was working as a Data
            Verifier at StepChange Debt Charity (yes, it's as mundane as it
            sounds). I quickly grew quite fed up in this role and started
            messing around with VB scripts and Excel to create a 'note
            generator/template' app for my department to use. The development of
            this became my full-time job and over time I added additional
            features.

            Eventually, this got me recognised by the IT department, and I got
            my first job in IT as a Service Desk Engineer. Although this gave me
            my first step into IT, it was never really for me (I possessed
            little patience for resetting passwords). However, I always knew I
            wanted to pursue the whole web/app developer thing, so I applied for
            internal web developer roles. Finally, after my third attempt, I got
            a Junior 'Web Developer' job.

            The job turned out to be more application support than web
            development. The majority of the role consisted of working with SQL
            to run a fix into the database...pretty dull stuff. I began teaching
            myself C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML and CSS, eventually I felt
            confident enough to take things to the next level, so I put myself
            out there to find a 'proper' dev job.

            I landed at Answer Digital; they were a digital consultancy, and the
            role included a three-month training academy to learn the
            fundamentals of full-stack development. The tech stack was .NET on
            the back-end with various JS frameworks. After only a few months on
            the job, I'd been on several different projects, with each one
            involving a different set of technologies. Out of all the
            technologies/languages/frameworks I touched, React and TypeScript
            became my favourite.
