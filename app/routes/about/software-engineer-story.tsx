        How I became a software engineer
      </h2>
      <p>
        My first 'proper' job after University was working as a Data Verifier at
        StepChange Debt Charity (yes, it's as mundane as it sounds). I quickly
        grew quite fed up this role and started messing around with VB scripts
        and Excel to create a 'note generator/template' app for my department to
        use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, this got me recognised by the IT department and I got my
        first job in IT as a Service Desk Engineer. Although this gave me my
        first step into the world of IT, it was never really for me (I posessed
        little patience for resetting passwords). I always knew that I wanted to
        pursue the whole web/app developer thing
