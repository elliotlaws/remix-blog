Making your site accessible forces you to really think about the user experience. UI/UX designers tend to have this baked into their thinking when designing for a new app, for example they’ll ensure that text on the page is readable (no smaller than 16px) and items are discoverable by using contrasting colours etc.

As developers, accessibility can sometimes be an afterthought. Some are of the opinion that the because their user base tends to be of a certain demographic and are not likely to have accessibility needs, they therefore don’t need to put much importance on it. However...this logic is flawed.

In this post I’ll talk about the two less obvious benefits of creating accessible web applications. These are:

- SEO
- Testing

One of the main reasons for making your application more accessible is to allow screen readers to read the information on the page and allow the user to effectively navigate and use your app. In order to achieve this you’ll have to ensure that your app adheres to the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This isn’t just a case of putting aria-label on every html element though, along with a few other things, it’s also really important to create semantically correct HTML.

Taken from the React docs

_Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility in a web application. Using the various HTML elements to reinforce the meaning of information in our websites will often give us accessibility for free._

Another thing it does is improve SEO positioning. Semantic HTML provides search engines with more context about your site. In the case of Google, they use an algorithm that analyses the code of your website. So using correct semantics would help in a higher ranking of positions that in turn would help our website reach more users.
