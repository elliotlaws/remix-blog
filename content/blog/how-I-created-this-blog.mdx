### Tech and services used

Here is a quick rundown of the services and tech used:

- Remix Run - My JS framework of choice
- Tailwind CSS - utility classes for styling
- MDX Bundler - for bundling MDX files
- Framer motion - animation library
- Workers KV - Where I store my compiled MDX content
- Cloudflare Pages - To host the site
- Cloudflare Images - For hosting and serving responsive images
- Github Actions - CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions

I'll briefly detail the steps I took to build the site in this post, but it won't be a in-depth walthrough/tutorial. Maybe I'll post this at a later date.

Full disclosure, I've got to give credit to [kiliman](https://github.com/kiliman/kiliman-dev/blob/main/scripts/mdx/compile-mdx.mjs) for the implementation of using Github actions to compile MDX content and push to a Workers KV. It's an excellent alternative for working around the restriction of not having access to a node environment using Cloudflare.

Here is a rough order in which I built the site:

- Setup Remix project with Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Created new Github repo and integrated with Cloudflare Pages
- Ensured I could deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Added blog content in the form of MDX files
- CompileMDX script
- Created GitHub actions to compile and post changed MDX content to a Workers KV
- Served responsive images on the site (hosted in Cloudflare Images)
- Added dark/light mode support

### What do I want to do in future?

- Add support for post tags/keywords so you can see posts relating to a particular topic.
