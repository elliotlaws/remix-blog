When I get my hands on a new mac, I always forget how to set up the terminal the way I like. So, in this post, I’ll go through the steps I take to set up my terminal to get it looking all fancy with syntax highlighting and autocomplete etc.

## 1. iTerm

Install latest iTerms [https://iterm2.com/downloads.html](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

## 2. Install Oh My Zsh

Install oh-my-zsh using curls

```bash
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Make zsh the default shell `chsh -s $(which zsh)` then log out and log back in again to use your new default shell.

## 4. Set the theme

Install Powerlevel10k

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Then enable it, change the value of ZSH_THEME to following in `~/.zshrc` file. Open using `open ~/.zshrc` , save file and then restart terminal.

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

After the terminal has been restarted complete the questions to configure the theme.

## 5. Install plugins

Clone the zsh-autosuggestions repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load (inside `~/.zshrc`)

```bash
plugins=(
    # other plugins...
    zsh-autosuggestions
)
```

Install zsh-syntax-highlighting

Clone the repo and source the script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
echo "source ${(q-)PWD}/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc
```

Then, enable syntax highlighting in the current interactive shell

```bash
source ./zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

## 6. Configure VS Code

In VS code, open settings.json and add the following to set the default terminal profile and ensure icons show correctly.

```bash
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "zsh",
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF"
```
